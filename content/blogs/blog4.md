title: STEM Ambassador Work
---

During my time at Glasgow University, I served as a STEM Ambassador. This involved engaging closely with the local communities and minority groups, delivering talks on STEM careers and degrees, and building relationships between academia and industry. This fed into my role as a Young Professional Ambassador for the Institution of Engineering and Technology. 

These were not only the most fulfilling activities I have engaged in, but served to build my public speaking and communication skills too.
