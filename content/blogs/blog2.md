JetX Engineering provides the unique opportunity to students to conceptualise, design, and manufacture functioning jet engines. Throughout my time in this society, I served as an aerodynamics engineer, designing the fan and compressor system of the engine we were working on. Find out more about the society through the following link:

This experience aided my professional skills development, having to give regular presentations and updates to the rest of the society, and engage effectively with my team, as well as managing communications with other teams. The collaborative nature of this project pushed me to become an effective communicator, and confident speaker.
