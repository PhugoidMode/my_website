As part of a writing exercise hosted by the London Business School Writing Club, we were prompted to write about a day in our life. The following is my take on this prompt: 

I hate alarms. I’ve never really liked anything, and I’ve certainly hated a lot of things, but alarms stand out. I’ve tried different tones, different phones, and old-fashioned wake-the-whole-neighbourhood bell alarms- and I still hate them all. No matter what I try, every morning my arm finds its way to hit snooze, reaching out for nine more minutes of pointless sleep before being assaulted, again, by that godforsaken alarm. Yesterday I hit snooze twice, today three times. Sometimes five. It’s nice to have some variety I suppose, because after I draw myself up off the bed, defeated by the alarm, I eat the same breakfast as the day before. I live in Britain, so I eat to the same sound of rain as the day before, to the same dark morning as the day before, and with the same disappointment in my breakfast as the day before. Some people tell me they wish they could turn back time, live through the days again, but I know better. I know they’ll be the same as today, and as tomorrow. And it always starts with that goddam alarm. I’d tell you about lunch, and the evening, and maybe even the night if I was really feeling it, but you surely know how they pass. You can sense the anger with which I mechanically set my alarm every night, the pathetic fury at my inability to do something so basic as wake up, the disgust as that little alarm appears in the top right corner of the phone screen, mocking me, waiting for me, waiting to see me time and time again, in nine-minute intervals, daring my finger to fumble its way to the snooze button.
